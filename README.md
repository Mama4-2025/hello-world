# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Fortunately, I am a 31 year old mother of 4, and have 3 sons and 1 daughter.😍
I spend a lot of time teaching, as I homeschool all of my children.
In my everyday life, I am always excited to learn something new, which aids in homeschooling.
My current hobby is raising and collecting chickens.🐣🐔
